npm install react-hot-toast axios socket.io-client
âœ… Why install them together?

These packages often work together in modern web apps like:

    Chat apps (toast for message sent, axios for REST APIs, socket.io for live updates)

    Dashboards (toast for alerts, axios for data fetching, socket.io for live data)

    Notification systems (socket for push updates, toast for showing them)
